TUIOdroid is an open source TUIO tracker for Android devices, which allows multi-touch remote control based on the TUIO protocol. It is capable of sending 
standard TUIO/UDP messages through any active 3G or WIFI connection. This application will be made available free of charge on the Android Market and can be 
used in conjunction with any TUIO enabled client application. Its source code is also available under the terms of the GPL and therefore can be freely used 
for the creation of open source TUIO enabled mobile applications. Apart from that TUIOdroid is also a useful tool for the development and testing of TUIO 1.1 
client implementations.
